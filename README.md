# TCGA-Mitosis

The folder orchestra_sync contains the scripts used to run the analyses.

orchestra_sync/rolling_stack_training.py is the most recent, up to data one that trains a convolutional netwrok while using a boosting algorithm to improve results.

The folder orchestra_images contains some of the image results data.

The folder cloud_server contains an entire, fully contained web app for crowdsourcing the annotation of mitotic figures.

Folders that **must** be downloaded and are not provided in this repo include train, a folder that contained mitotic slide images and can be downloaded from the ludo17.free.fr/mitos_2012/download.html ICPR competition, and test, a folder that can be downloaded from the same place.
